Define a GameLogic class in ten_thousand/game_logic.py file.
Handle calculating score for dice roll
Add calculate_score static method to GameLogic class.
The input to calculate_score is a tuple of integers that represent a dice roll.
The output from calculate_score is an integer representing the rollâ€™s score according to rules of game.

      class GameLogic:
          @staticmethod
          def calculate_score(dice_roll):
              score = 0

              # Calculate score based on the rules of the game
              counts = [0] * 7  # Initialize a list to count the occurrences of each dice value

              for dice in dice_roll:
                  counts[dice] += 1

              # Check for scoring combinations
              if counts[1] >= 3:
                  score += 1000
                  counts[1] -= 3

              for i in range(2, 7):
                  if counts[i] >= 3:
                      score += i * 100
                      counts[i] -= 3

              score += counts[1] * 100  # Add remaining 1's
              score += counts[5] * 50  # Add remaining 5's

              return score

## for testing

once the main bulk of the code was done, we then wrote test driven code and asked gpt to help write code for this specific test and we did this for a handle full of tests

example:

Prompt: *insert code here

modify the code to work with this test:

    def test_five_of_a_kind():
        actual = GameLogic.calculate_score((2, 2, 2, 2, 2))
        expected = 600
        assert actual == expected

output:

    if counts[1] == 5:
      score += 3000 
      return score








    create a scoring guide for the farkle game using the Counter library in python

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an example of a scoring guide for the Farkle game using the Counter library in Python:

python
Copy code
from collections import Counter

def calculate_score(dice):
    score = 0
    counter = Counter(dice)

    # Scoring for individual dice
    score += counter[1] * 100  # Each '1' is worth 100 points
    score += counter[5] * 50   # Each '5' is worth 50 points

    # Scoring for combinations
    for num, count in counter.items():
        if count >= 3:  # Three or more of a kind
            if num == 1:  # Three '1's
                score += 1000
            else:         # Three of any other number
                score += num * 100

            if count > 3:  # Additional dice beyond three
                score += (count - 3) * num * 100

        # Special scoring for specific combinations
        if num == 1 or num == 5:
            continue

        if count == 4:  # Four of a kind
            score += num * 100

        if count == 5:  # Five of a kind
            score += num * 200

        if count == 6:  # Six of a kind
            score += num * 300

    return score
